# [DonorsChoose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DonorsChoose)

DonorsChoose is a United States-based nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. The organization has been given Charity Navigator's highest rating every year since 2005.[4] In January 2018, they announced that 1 million projects had been funded. In 80% of public schools in the United States, at least one project has been requested on DonorsChoose. Schools from wealthy areas are more likely to make technology requests, while schools from less affluent areas are more likely to request basic supplies.[6] It has been noted that repeat donors on DonorsChoose typically donate to projects they have no prior relationship with, and most often fund projects serving financially challenged students.
